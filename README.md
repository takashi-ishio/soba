# SOBA - Simple Objects for Bytecode Analysis 

This class library is a wrapper of ASM library to execute simple control-flow and data-flow analysis on Java bytecode.
Compared with WALA and Soot, this library implements relatively simple features.  Instead, the library requires a smaller number of parameters.


## Build

The library uses Maven to build the system.

       mvn package
